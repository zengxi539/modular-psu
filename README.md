### Introduction

EEZ Bench Box 3 (BB3) represents a new category of *modular* Test and Measurement (T&M) equipment. It provides a complete open-source hardware and software framework that bridges the gap between – and combines the best features of – DIY hobbyist tools and professional benchtop equipment. 
BB3 was inspired by the [EEZ H24005](https://github.com/eez-open/psu-hw) power supply project ([OSHWA UID HR000001](https://certification.oshwa.org/hr000001.html)), which attracted many enthusiasts with its broad feature-set, rich user interface, DIY-friendliness, and fully open-source design. 
It initially comes with two DC power modules (hence the name of repository *modular-psu*) and will be expanded with new T&M modules (e.g. multi-channel power source, 2/4-quadrant power module, multi-channel temperature sensor module, data logger, switch matrix, digital I/O expander, function generator, data acquisition module, etc.). 
BB3 is made up of the following components:

* _[BP3C](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/bp3c)_ EEZ DIB backplane with power output coupling capability of first two modules
* _[AUX power supply](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/aux-ps)_ board with AC input protection, soft-start/power-up control, DC fan controller and +5 V / +12 V power outputs
* _[MCU](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/mcu)_ board based on STM32F769IIT6 32-bit ARM Cortex-M7
* _[DCP405](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/dcp405)_, 0 - 40 V / 50 mA / 5 A DC power source module
* _[DCM220](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/dcm220)_, dual sync buck 0 - 20 V / max. 4 A module
* _[Metal enclosure](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/enclosure)_ for housing up to 3 modules with 4.3" TFT LCD. Dimensions: 290 (W) x 123 (H) x 240 (D) mm
